Based on the following context, generate a Git commit message:

Branch: {{context.branch}}

Recent commits:
{{recent_commits}}

Author's recent commit history:
{{author_history}}

Staged changes:
{{staged_changes}}

Project metadata:
{{project_metadata}}

Detailed changes:
{{detailed_changes}}

When generating the commit message, analyze the author's recent commit history above and adapt your writing style to match their typical patterns, tone, and formatting preferences. This will ensure consistency with their previous work.
